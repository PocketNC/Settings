# five_axis_kinematics

This feature requires a custom built version of MachineKit that
enables the use of G60 and G60.1 to enable and disable five axis kinematics. 
Five axis kinematics allows G code instructions to be given in work piece
coordinates with the A and B coordinates indicating the orientation of the tool.
