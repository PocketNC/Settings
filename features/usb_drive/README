This feature makes use of USBmount, and open source package maintained here:
https://github.com/rbrito/usbmount

There is a usbmount dependency, lockfile-progs, that was pre-instaled on the 3.8-1 kernel.
It is absent on the 4.19.59-bone-rt-r36 kernel, so we'll need to install it on those boards.

usbmount versions beyond 0.0.22 do not work on our boards running the 3.8-1 kernel.
It is probably related to a change in how symlinks are handled in the first commit after 0.0.22 
usbmount uses symlinks to provide a single consistent mount point, but we are not using this feature.

There is a known bug in 0.0.22. Drives with NTFS format will fail to automatically dismount
if physically removed without ejecting safely. Then when re-inserted, usbmount will use the next of it's
8 available directories to re-mount. So after 8 cycles of hot-plugging, the 9th will fail.
The USB eject button provided in the UI will unmount all the occupied slots.
